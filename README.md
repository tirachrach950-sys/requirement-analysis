# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository focuses on the **Requirement Analysis phase** of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It aims to document, analyze, and structure software requirements for a hypothetical booking management system.  
The goal is to provide a **clear blueprint** for development by capturing functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves **gathering, analyzing, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders** for a software system.  

The main objectives of Requirement Analysis are:  
- To **understand what the software must achieve** and the problems it should solve.  
- To **document functional requirements** (features and functionalities) and **non-functional requirements** (performance, security, usability, scalability).  
- To **provide a clear blueprint** for the design and development teams, reducing misunderstandings and project risks.  

### Importance in SDLC:
1. **Prevents Scope Creep:** Clearly defining requirements avoids unexpected additions during development.  
2. **Guides Design and Development:** Provides structured documentation for developers and designers.  
3. **Improves Quality:** Ensures the final software meets stakeholdersâ€™ expectations.  
4. **Enhances Communication:** Creates a shared understanding among stakeholders, developers, and testers.  

In short, Requirement Analysis lays the **foundation for successful software development** by ensuring that all project goals are clearly understood and agreed upon before coding begins.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a critical step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the software meets the needs of stakeholders and reduces risks during development.  

### Key Reasons:

1. **Prevents Scope Creep:**  
   By clearly defining and documenting requirements, the team can avoid unexpected changes or additions during development, keeping the project on track.

2. **Guides Design and Development:**  
   Well-analyzed requirements serve as a blueprint for designers and developers, ensuring that the system is built correctly from the start.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several important activities that ensure the software meets stakeholder needs. The key activities are:

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  Collecting information about what the stakeholders want from the system using interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and observations.

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Refining and exploring gathered information through discussions, brainstorming sessions, and prototyping to uncover hidden needs and expectations.

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  Recording the requirements in a structured and clear format, such as requirement specifications, use cases, and user stories.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
  Organizing and analyzing requirements to identify relationships, priorities, and potential conflicts. Creating visual models like use case diagrams to better understand the system.

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are complete, feasible, and correctly reflect business needs before development begins.

3. **Improves Software Quality:**  
   Understanding user needs and expectations reduces the likelihood of defects, ensures user satisfaction, and helps deliver a reliable and efficient system.

4. **Enhances Communication:**  
   Requirement Analysis creates a common understanding among stakeholders, developers, and testers, reducing misunderstandings and rework.
## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are classified into **Functional** and **Non-functional** requirements. Both are crucial for defining what the system should do and how it should perform.

### Functional Requirements
**Definition:** Functional requirements describe the specific features, functions, and behavior that the system must provide to meet user needs.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- User registration and login
- Property search with filters (location, price, type)
- Detailed property view with images and descriptions
- Booking and payment processing
- User profile management
- Review and rating system

### Non-functional Requirements
**Definition:** Non-functional requirements describe **how the system should perform**, focusing on qualities like performance, usability, reliability, and security.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- Page load time under 2 seconds
- Secure login and encrypted data storage
- Mobile responsive design
- System scalability to handle multiple concurrent users
- User-friendly and intuitive interface
- Availability of 99.9% uptime
## Use Case Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** are a visual representation of the interactions between **actors** (users or external systems) and the system itself.  
They help to illustrate **system functionality**, clarify requirements, and communicate effectively with stakeholders.

### Benefits:
- Provides a **clear overview** of system functionality.  
- Helps identify **primary actors and their interactions** with the system.  
- Supports **requirement validation** and discussion with stakeholders.
