# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository focuses on the **Requirement Analysis phase** of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It aims to document, analyze, and structure software requirements for a hypothetical booking management system.  
The goal is to provide a **clear blueprint** for development by capturing functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves **gathering, analyzing, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders** for a software system.  

The main objectives of Requirement Analysis are:  
- To **understand what the software must achieve** and the problems it should solve.  
- To **document functional requirements** (features and functionalities) and **non-functional requirements** (performance, security, usability, scalability).  
- To **provide a clear blueprint** for the design and development teams, reducing misunderstandings and project risks.  

### Importance in SDLC:
1. **Prevents Scope Creep:** Clearly defining requirements avoids unexpected additions during development.  
2. **Guides Design and Development:** Provides structured documentation for developers and designers.  
3. **Improves Quality:** Ensures the final software meets stakeholdersâ€™ expectations.  
4. **Enhances Communication:** Creates a shared understanding among stakeholders, developers, and testers.  

In short, Requirement Analysis lays the **foundation for successful software development** by ensuring that all project goals are clearly understood and agreed upon before coding begins.
