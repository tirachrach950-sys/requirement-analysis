# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository focuses on the **Requirement Analysis phase** of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It aims to document, analyze, and structure software requirements for a hypothetical booking management system.  
The goal is to provide a **clear blueprint** for development by capturing functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria.
